```
After completing these steps, your environment should be ready to go!

### Upgrade UELer
To update UELer, navigate to your UELer directory and run:
```shell
git pull
```

## Getting started
1. Open your favorite editor that supports Jupyter notebook.
2. Navigate to the cloned UELer repository, then open the notebook `/script/run_viewer.ipynb`.
3. Select the kernel for an ark-analysis compatible conda/micromamba env.
4. Change the lines according to the instructions in the notebook: when configuring the `/script/run_viewer.ipynb`, ensure that you specify the following directory paths:
  - **`viewer_dir`**: The directory path where the UELer folder is located (e.g., `.../UELer`).
  - **`base_folder`**: The directory containing the FOV (Field of View) folders with image data (e.g., `.../image_data`).
  - **`masks_folder`**: The directory containing the segmentation `.tif` files for cell segmentation (e.g., `.../segmentation/cellpose_output`).
  - **`cell_table_path`**: The path to the file containing the cell table data (e.g., `.../segmentation/cell_table/cell_table_size_normalized.csv`).
Make sure these paths are correctly set in the notebook for the viewer to access the data correctly.

5. Run the code and you will see the viewer displayed.

## User interface
![GUI_preview](/doc/GUI_preview.png)
The GUI can be split into four main regions (wide plugins toggle the optional footer automatically):
- left: overall settings (channel, annotation, and mask accordions)
- middle: main viewer with overlay controls and image navigation
- right: plugin tools (Mask Painter, ROI Manager, palette editors, statistics panels)
- bottom (optional): wide plugin tabs (e.g., horizontal heatmap or gallery extensions)

### Overall Settings
- **Cache Size**: Defines the number of images that can be loaded into memory at one time.  
- **Select Image**: Choose an image to display in the main viewer.  
- **Channel Selection**: Select the channels you want to display. You can select multiple channels by holding down the **Shift** key and clicking.  
- **Marker Set**: Load a pre-defined marker set, which includes channels, colors, and color ranges.
- **Control sections**: Channel, annotation, and mask controls now live in a collapsible accordion so you can jump straight to the section you need. When annotations are available, their controls appear ahead of masks, and each pane scrolls independently to keep the palette tools in reach even with dozens of channels.
- **Annotations**: When `<base_folder>/annotations` contains rasters named `<fov>_<annotation>.tif(f)`, enable the overlay toggle to color pixels by class. Choose between mask outlines, annotation fills, or a combined view, adjust fill opacity, and launch the palette editor to customize class colors and display labels. Annotation names can include spaces (for example, `Simple Segmentation`)—they remain selectable and the **Edit palette…** button now activates as soon as such an entry loads.
- **Masks**: Load segmentation rasters, edit per-class colours, and save or recall `.maskcolors.json` sets—default colours are tracked automatically, and optional `ipyfilechooser` dialogs speed up import/export.

### Tools & Plugins
- **Mask Painter**: Focus on edited classes, reuse colour sets, and jump between identifiers without leaving the plugin.
- **ROI Manager**: Capture, centre, and tag regions of interest with persistent storage in `<base_folder>/.UELer/roi_manager.csv`; combo-box tagging keeps new labels available for future sessions.
- **Wide Plugins**: Enable "Horizontal layout" (for example, in the heatmap plugin) to undock the tool into the footer while keeping the accordion available for other controls.

## New Update  
### v0.1.10
**Assign tab activation**
- Wired `HeatmapDisplay` to observe `current_clusters["index"]` so the Assign tab's `Meta-cluster ID` field and Apply button enable as soon as a cluster selection exists and disable when it clears ([issue #9](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/9)).
- Initialized the observer during widget restore to keep the controls accurate after notebook reloads, preventing stale disabled states when selections persist across sessions ([issue #9](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/9)).

**Automatic cutoff locking**
- Re-engaged the Lock Cutoff control automatically after meta-cluster assignments and dendrogram edits so patches immediately regain protection from accidental reclassification ([issue #10](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/10)).
- Added a guarded “Unlock once” workflow that forces users to request a one-time override before editing the cutoff, restoring the lock after changes and keeping manual toggles from bypassing the safeguard ([issue #10](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/10)).

**Chart footer placement**
- Updated `ChartDisplay` so the plugin automatically refreshes the footer when multiple scatter plots are active, keeping controls in the bottom tab while leaving a clear notice in the sidebar ([issue #5](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/5)).
- Added `tests/test_chart_footer_behavior.py` with lightweight widget and data stubs to guard the layout toggle and footer refresh workflow ([issue #5](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/5)).

**Heatmap footer stability**
- Ensured the heatmap plugin reattaches its canvas during footer rebuilds so horizontal heatmaps persist after scatter plots are added or removed in the chart plugin ([issue #6](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/6)).
- Expanded `tests/test_chart_footer_behavior.py` to simulate combined chart and heatmap footer refreshes, guaranteeing the heatmap remains registered in `BottomPlots` following scatter changes ([issue #6](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/6)).

**Footer pane caching**
- Reworked `viewer/ui_components.update_wide_plugin_panel` to cache wide plugin panes, preserving live matplotlib canvases when the chart toggles between sidebar and footer layouts ([issue #6](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/6)).
- Extended `tests/test_wide_plugin_panel.py` with cache-aware stubs so chart relocations reuse the existing heatmap pane instead of instantiating a fresh widget tree ([issue #6](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/6)).

**Heatmap redraw automation**
- Triggered the heatmap footer pane to replay its Plot routine whenever a cached wide layout is reused so horizontal canvases repopulate immediately after chart-driven footer rebuilds ([issue #6](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/6)).
- Added a regression to `tests/test_wide_plugin_panel.py` asserting cached panes invoke the redraw helper every time the footer recomposes, preventing future regressions ([issue #6](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/6)).

**Wide heatmap tick alignment**
- Centered tick locations and histogram bins in horizontal heatmaps so column and row labels sit on the underlying grid instead of drifting half a cell off to the left/top ([issue #8](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/8)).
- Added regression coverage around the tick-label helper to guard against future misalignment regressions in wide mode ([issue #8](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/8)).

**Cluster ID persistence**
- Cached `meta_cluster_revised` overrides before rebuilding heatmaps and restored them afterward so manual assignments survive horizontal/vertical layout toggles ([issue #11](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/11)).
- Added focused regression tests that exercise the caching helper to prevent future regressions in manual assignment retention ([issue #11](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/11)).

**Annotation overlays & control layout**
- Added `load_annotations_for_fov` plus rich overlay controls (mode toggle, opacity slider, palette editor launcher) so pixel annotations render as fills, outlines, or both directly in the main viewer; reshaped the left column into a scrollable accordion that keeps annotations ahead of masks and anchors the palette editor for easy access ([issue #21](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/21)).
- Normalised annotation discovery for both Dask and NumPy rasters, enabled palette editing for names containing spaces, and prevented startup crashes when restoring widget states with already-materialised composites ([issue #21](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer/issues/21)).

**Footer-wide plugin layouts**
- Introduced the bottom-tab host (`BottomPlots`) and helper utilities so plugins can opt into a full-width footer without vacating the accordion; the heatmap plugin now moves into the footer when “Horizontal layout” is enabled and returns gracefully when toggled off ([issue #24](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/24)).
- Hardened plugin observer setup to cope with `SimpleNamespace` registries, eliminating the footer-related startup regression ([issue #24](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/24)).

**ROI management & tagging**
- Shipped a persistent `ROIManager` backend backing onto `<base_folder>/.UELer/roi_manager.csv`, complete with import/export helpers, timestamping, and a dedicated accordion plugin for capture, centring, and metadata edits ([issue #16](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/16)).
- Rebuilt the tag workflow with a ComboBox + TagsInput hybrid that normalises and preserves new labels even under restrictive widget front-ends, covering multiple regression scenarios in unit tests ([issue #23](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/23)).

**Mask painter & channel workflows**
- Added mask colour set persistence (`.maskcolors.json`), default-colour management, optional `ipyfilechooser` support, and identifier-aware palette switching, alongside UI affordances to focus on edited classes ([issue #18](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/18)).
- Centralised channel intensity caching via `merge_channel_max`, updated contrast slider formatting, and clarified mask loading so binary rasters are promoted to labelled images with consistent naming ([issue #15](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/15)).

**Test & developer support**
- Added targeted suites covering palettes, mask colour persistence, ROI tagging, and footer layout assembly (`tests/test_annotation_palettes.py`, `tests/test_mask_color_sets.py`, `tests/test_roi_manager_tags.py`, `tests/test_wide_plugin_panel.py`) to guard against future regressions ([issues #21](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/21), [#23](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/23), [#24](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/24)).

**Chart gallery upgrades**
- Replaced both chart accordions with `jupyter-scatter` for multi-plot scatter views, including the heatmap variant; selections now sync across all active plots, the footer automatically hosts multi-plot layouts, and histogram fallbacks remain available ([issue #22](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/22)).
- Added `anywidget>=0.9` as a dependency for the new scatter widgets—make sure the environment that launches JupyterLab has `pip install anywidget` applied (and, if you use a separate Lab environment, install `anywidget` there as well so the `@anywidget/jupyterlab` federated extension is available).
- Streamlined the heatmap plugin's selection handling so scatter clicks and lasso selections update row highlights in-place instead of rebuilding the entire dendrogram, dramatically improving responsiveness during linked exploration ([issue #25](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/25)).

**Heatmap enhancement**
- Refreshed the heatmap's meta-cluster patches so horizontal (wide) layouts redraw their column highlights immediately after reassignment, keeping footer views synced with cluster edits ([issue #26](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/26)).
- Restored the heatmap → chart linkage so clicking a heatmap cell recolors and highlights the linked scatter plots via the shared `ScatterPlotWidget` API—no more stale Matplotlib handles when `Chart` is linked ([issue #27](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/27)).
- Promoted the lightweight `HeatmapModeAdapter` scaffold into the primary layout engine so both vertical and wide heatmaps share the same histogram, cutoff, and palette logic with far less branching inside `viewer/plugin/heatmap.py`.
- Continued the refactor by breaking `HeatmapDisplay` into dedicated data, interaction, and display mixins, leaving the orchestrator class focused on wiring while keeping the public plugin API intact (refactor plan step 5-6).
- Fixed the “Horizontal layout” toggle so it once again flips the plugin into wide mode after the mixin refactor.
- Reduced orientation drift by funnelling heatmap drawing and click handling through shared helpers, so vertical and horizontal layouts highlight, recolor, and log selections identically.
- Eliminated the disappearing heatmap regression when scatter plots trigger a footer refresh—the vertical layout now reattaches its canvas after bottom-panel rebuilds so plotting order no longer matters ([issue #28](https://github.com/HartmannLab/UELer_alpha/issues/28)).
